E-COMMERCE REACT PROJECT
   As at 2019, there were 2.06 million Africans living in the New York,1.202 million, New York, some have access to their natives products at special places while others do not. And yet they all  need or use products from their countries.
   At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has  become  very unsafe to go to crowded places like supermarkets and  other shops.
   On the otherhand the E-commerce business was/is booming and very successful in the pandemic, but there was one issue that still needed to be addressed.
   This issue was that the other E-commerce websites that sold some of these native products sold them at a very expensive prices
   Sam Boat Ventures came as a solution to these problems, to provide our valued customers with their products and also a immigrants or people with different demographic backgrounds
 Sam Boat Ventures seeks to solve this by providing our valued customers with a wide range of products with different prices to meet their needs and wants.
 
  React Was Used For this Project 
  I used two API's and they are:
  https://mod2-countdown.herokuapp.com/?search_term=${searchHistory}
  http://api.timezonedb.com/v2.1/get-time-zone?key=VF4D9XZWJ4CT&format=json&by=zone&zone=America/New_York
  I used Axios to fetch my API in App.js
  I made one parent component and eight children components in it 
  I used useReducer and useContext hooks to pass down State in the ProductForm.js
  I also used react router to make routes in APP.js, and also made the links in Nav.js
  
  Plans For The Future
  Develop an API that better helps me the purpose of the displaying the products from different demographics
  Develop a cart 
  Add some animations and more design to the website.
